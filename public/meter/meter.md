# What is meter Blockchain?
* Meter.io is a highly decentralized Ethereum scaling solution with a built-in metastable gas currency. It connects to Ethereum and other blockchains as a layer-two protocol and allows smart contracts to scale and communicate seamlessly through heterogeneous blockchain networks.


* Meter_io Passport is a fork of ChainSafe's ChainBridge
* with one change introduced to the deposit method of the ERC20 Handler.

```
This change basically assumes that if the token being bridged is wrapped Native token then it doesnâ€™t burn or lock since the wrapped Native token is already unwrapped and the amount transferred to the handler contract.
```

##  method 1

* The assumption holds true for one of the deposit methods depositEth which also asserts the value of amount in calldata
* (which will then ultimately get passed to the handler's deposit method):

## method 2

* the assumption doesn't hold true for another method deposit in the same contract which is mostly unguarded.

* The extended code had a wrong trust assumption which allowed hacker to call the underlying ERC20 deposit function to fake an BNB or ETH transfer.

## hack

* Hacker notices method2 - and sends an arbitrary amount in the calldata, which gets passed on the handler's deposit.

* The extended code had a wrong trust assumption which allowed hacker to call the underlying ERC20 deposit function to fake an BNB or ETH transfer.
